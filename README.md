## history of `Ws`

in 2011 `quinn` watched
[`jeff hawkin`'s talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing) on artificial
general inmagination(`AGI`) & `quinn 1` bcame obsessed with building `AGI` 2
help humanity. `quinn 2` taught `quinn 1` how 2 code & built an
object-oriented(OO) java implementation of [numenta's cortical learning algorithm version 2(`CLA v2`)](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_II). after running
unsuccessful vision experiments using the `CLA v2` `quinn 3` began 2 think
there must b 1+ better options 2 build `AGI`. `hunter nathanael smith`,
`cheryl wu`, & `myron barnstone` died by suicide & `quinn 3` bcame `q`. `q 1`
found 1 better approach in `dileep george`'s
[phd thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/Dileep_George_PGM/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf) & this project changed in2 an
[OO python implementation of `dileep`'s phd thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_III). while researching other approaches 2 `AGI` `q 2` found
[`elon musk`'s ideas on AGI](https://youtu.be/h0962biiZa4) & read
[superintelligence by `nick bostrom`](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) with `q 3`'s notes
[here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/345) & realized `quinn` &
`q <= 3` made false assumptions about building `AGI` 2 help humanity in the 1st
place. the goal changed 2 researching how 2 increase human inmagination faster
than code based inmagination. the hypothesis `q 4 -> 414` is stuck on is since
`GEI`(general emotional inmagination as a better name 4 `AGI`) will !b limited by
slow biological processes, it is  !possible 4 human inmagination 2 increase
faster than code based inmagination in the long-term. `q` is using a
priority checklist of 130 mental models 2 brainstorm alternative solutions 2
the `GEI` problem. `q` is `!` sure what the solutions r but 1 possible solution is a neurl lace bing built by [neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com).
