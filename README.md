## history of Ws

In 2011 `Quinn` watched 
[`Jeff Hawkin`'s talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing) on artificial 
general intelligence(`AGI`) & `Quinn 1` bcame obsessed with building `AGI` 2 help humanity. `Quinn 2` taught `Quinn 1` how 2 
code & built an object-oriented(OO) Java implementation of [Numenta's cortical learning algorithm version 2(`CLA v2`)](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_II). After running unsuccessful vision experiments using the `CLA v2` `Quinn 3` 
began 2 think there must b 1+ better options 2 build `AGI`. `Hunter Nathanael Smith`, `Cheryl Wu`, & `Myron Barnstone` died by 
suicide & `Quinn 3` bcame `Q`. `Q 1` found 1 better approach in `Dileep George`'s
[PhD thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/Dileep_George_PGM/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf) & this project changed
in2 an [OO Python implementation of `Dileep`'s PhD thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_III). While 
researching other approaches 2 `AGI` `Q 2` found [`Elon Musk`'s ideas on AGI](https://youtu.be/h0962biiZa4)
& read [Superintelligence by `Nick Bostrom`](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) 
with `Q 3`'s notes [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/345) & realized `Quinn` & `Q <= 3` made false assumptions 
about building `AGI` 2 help humanity in the 1st place. The goal changed 2 researching how 2 increase human 
intelligence faster than code based intelligence. The hypothesis `Q 4 -> 414` is stuck on is since AGI will `!`b limited by 
slow biological processes, it isn't possible 4 human intelligence 2 increase faster than code based intelligence in the long-term. `Q < 454...` is using a checklist of 129 mental models 2 brainstorm alternative solutions 2 the AGI problem. `Q` met 
some1 which has caused `Q 456...` 2 revote & `!` b so sure AGIs r a problem that needs 2 b "fixed" anymore so long as they 
read the "right" sequence of books b4 they surpass human inmagination.
