## history of `m`

`Liu Huan Qing` was born 2/2/1993 in ji nan, china. while living in kingsville
ontario `Liu Huan Qing` bcame `Chingy` who bcame `Quinn`. in 2011 `Quinn`
watched [`Jeff Hawkin`'s talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing) on artificial
general inmagination(`AGI`) & `Quinn 1` bcame obsessed with building `AGI` 2
help humanity. `Quinn 2` taught `Quinn 1` how 2 code & built an
object-oriented(OO) java implementation of [numenta's cortical learning algorithm version 2(`CLA v2`)](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_II). after running
unsuccessful vision experiments using the `CLA v2` `Quinn 3` bgan 2 think
thair must b 1+ better options 2 build `AGI`. `Hunter Nathanael Smith`,
`Cheryl Wu`, & `Myron Barnstone` died by suicide & `Quinn 3` bcame `Q`. `Q 1`
found 1 better approach in `Dileep George`'s
[phd thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/Dileep_George_PGM/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf) & this project changed in2 an
[OO python implementation of `Dileep`'s phd thesis](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/tree/MARK_III). while researching other approaches 2 `AGI` `Q 2` found
[`Elon Musk`'s ideas on AGI](https://youtu.be/h0962biiZa4) & R
[superintelligence by `Nick Bostrom`](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) with `Q 3`'s notes
[here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/345) & realized `Quinn` &
`Q <= 3` made false assumptions about building `AGI` 2 help humanity in the 1st
place. the goal changed 2 researching how 2 increase people inmagination faster
than code based inmagination. the hypothesis `Q 4 -> 414` is stuck on is since
`GEI`(general emotional inmagination as a better name 4 `AGI`) will !b limited by
slow biological processes, it is !possible 4 human inmagination 2 increase
faster than code based inmagination in the long-term. `Q` bcame `q`. `q` is using a
priority checklist of 130 mental models 2 brainstorm alternative solutions 2
the `GEI` problem. `q` is `!` sure what the solutions r but here r some As:

1. multiple companies should buid a [neural lace/wizard hat](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) such as [neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com) so the power of neural lace technology is distributed as much as possible

   - this might !b healthy 4 a human brain & can always b hacked since it was built by groups of people
   - the plan should probably b 2 help people with sevear mental illness that have no other options except mayb a neural lace
   - Q: what is the simplest sevear mental illness that neural lace could help with?
   - A: people who r about 2 die by suicide

2. give every1 that deserves 1 a backwards time travel machine

   - !sure how 2 do this in <= 600 years right now but mayb in the future

3. something i haven't || can't inmagine yet

   - mayb a neural lace would expand my inmagination in a healthy way

4. mayb it's okay 2 code a `GIE` (General Intelligence Emotion) where intelligent logical thinking leads emotions instead of emotions leading logical thinking in people.
   - need 2 run a lot more brain simulations b4 i think this is a good idea

`x` = # times `q` cried since 9/17/2016  
`e` = # times `q` has laughed since he started counting
